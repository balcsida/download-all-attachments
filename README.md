# Download All Attachments

Tired of downloading Zendesk attachments one... at... a... time? I was, so I made this app. Download all attachments from a ticket with one click!

There's not really much to it. Install the app via the marketplace and it will show up in the sidebar. For a ticket with attachments, it gives you a button to click that will create a ZIP of all attachments and download it.

This app does all its work directly in the browser, making it a safe choice for corporate environments.

NOTE: this app is built with pretty new technology, meaning it may not work in older browsers. It has been tested in recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, IE, Edge, and Opera. However, I can't make any guarantees that it will work in your particular environment.

However, I would love to hear about any ways in which it could improve! Please feel free to email me at charles.adrian.wood@gmail.com.
